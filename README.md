### This is [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/) (aka [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) through edX).
 
Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

>*Demanding, but definitely doable. Social, but educational. A focused topic, but broadly applicable skills. CS50 is
 the quintessential Harvard (and Yale!) course.*
